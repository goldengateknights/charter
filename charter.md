Golden Gate Knights Charter

1 Introduction
Golden Gate Knights is a not-for-profit performance group comprised of individuals with a love of the Star Wars Universe and a passion for giving back to the community. The members of the Golden Gate Knights have banded together to recreate the saber battles seen in the films, television series, create their own stories, characters, and saber battles based in the Star Wars Universe, as well as teach anyone who would like to safely practice staged combat choreography. These saber battles and instruction are performed at events with the sole purpose of assisting charitable organizations and supporting the Star Wars community at large.

2 Mission
Our mission is to use our talents safely to support and raise awareness for various charity organizations and community functions. We accomplish this through the creation of costumes, props and performances that are loyal to the movies, films, and expanded media of the Star Wars Universe.

3 Vision
It is the vision of the Golden Gate Knights to promote a spirit of goodwill among its members and other organizations through assisting in various charity organizations, instructional classes and community functions. The Golden Gate Knights will also continue to improve the quality and safety of Star Wars costumes and props for all its members and to help members develop, practice and perform safe staged combat choreography.

4 Values
The Golden Gate Knights values every individual regardless of sex, race, religion, creed, nationality, sexual orientation or physical handicap. We value safety in rehearsal and performance for both our members and our audience. We value attention to high quality costumes that are safe for saber choreography. Finally, we value the charitable goals exemplified by Lucasfilm Ltd. by giving all we can to our community.

The primary focus of the Golden Gate Knights is to teach safe staged combat choreography and support charitable events in the community. As such, the conduct of our members is a direct reflection on those charities and classes. As members of the Golden Gate Knights, we also portray characters from the Star Wars universe and interact with the general public as those characters. With these conditions in mind, our members' conduct is of great importance and will not be taken lightly.

7.1 All members of the Golden Gate Knights will treat every individual with respect, courtesy, and gratitude for their involvement with the events in which they are participating. Behavior in violation of this code of conduct will be brought before the council. Those found in violation by the council may be subject to disciplinary actions.

Guests or members that do not adhere to these codes may be asked to leave an event and/or refrain from discussion in our online forums. Members may face disciplinary action based on their conduct depending on the severity of the situation.

9 Costume Requirements
All costumes will fall under one of two different categories, Show or Stunt. All costumes must be appropriate for viewing by the audience. Costumes must be clean, well maintained, and only show wear or weathering if that is the design of the costume. Each category has its own requirements and its very likely that a costume will qualify for only one or the other and not both. Members preparing a new costume are strongly encouraged to seek the guidance of a Fight Director, Costume Judge or both during purchase, creation, or completion of a costume.

9.1 Show Costumes
Costumes from the six Star Wars films, the Expanded Universe, unused conceptual art for the films, comics, books, games, and television shows based on the licensed Lucasfilm Limited Star Wars saga material or original costumes based in the Star Wars universe are eligible. Replica costumes should be as accurate to the source material as possible. Original costumes should be of the same design, style, and quality. Materials should be as close to the appearance of those used in the movies, TV series, or other media and should be of the highest quality as possible. Every effort should be made to produce a professional looking costume.

9.1a All Show costumes must be reviewed and approved by a Golden Gate Knights designated Costume Judge.

9.2 Stunt Costumes
Stunt costumes are those meant to recreate the costumes as seen in the films or expanded universe while allowing for safety and freedom of movement. Costumes of an original design must be of the same caliber.

9.2a All Stunt costumes must be reviewed and approved prior to each performance by the designated Fight Director. Safety requirements will include, but may not be limited to the following:
1. Material must allow for free movement of all joints, including the torso.
2. All items must be secured to the costume to avoid falling off during performance.
3. Items that detach easily and are not necessary for the performance must be removed.
4. When deemed necessary by the Fight Director, appropriate padding should be worn under the costume to help protect the performer for that event.

9.3 Weapons
All weapons should be inspected by a Golden Gate Knights Fight Director upon purchase or construction to ensure that they are of the appropriate design and will be safe to use. Performance members are encouraged to seek the guidance of the Fight Director prior to making a purchase to ensure that they are purchasing an appropriate weapon. All weapons to be used for an event must be reviewed by the Fight Director prior to the event.

9.3a Blade wall thickness shall be decided upon prior to the event. Every effort shall be made to be certain that blade wall thickness is uniform for all sabers used in the performance.

9.3b General Saber guidelines:
1. Blade tips affixed securely.
2. No or very little rattling.
3. No sharp edges or dangerous parts.
4. Blade is the appropriate length for the wielder, saber and style of the choreography.
5. No Acrylic blades. Blades should be polycarbonate only.
6. Blade type is consistent for the event or class.
7. Switches and recharge ports should be recessed, though this is not a requirement.
8. Weapons should be an appropriate weight for the wielder and easily controllable for choreography.
9. Though not a requirement, it is highly recommended for performance sabers to have sound and a “Flash on Clash” feature.

9.3c Further safety standards will be at the discretion of the Fight Director for a given event. For example, saber staffs could pose a safety hazard in some cases.

9.4 Costume Approval
All costumes used during events must go through an approval process.

9.4a Should any costume, Show or Stunt, be declined, the member will be provided with an explanation for denial, a list of missing requirements for the costume, and the name of the Costume Judge that made the assessment.

9.4b An applicant may appeal a costume's denial or classification by posting a request with the Golden Gate Knights Council. The Golden Gate Knights Council will review the request and the costume for a final ruling. An explanation of this ruling will accompany the response.

10 Charter Amendments
As circumstances occur and as the Golden Gate Knights grow as an organization, the need to amend the official Golden Gate Knights Charter will present itself. Below are the procedures that will be followed:

10.1 Presentation of Amendment
Any member in good standing may present a charter amendment to the Golden Gate Knights leadership via private message on the official Golden Gate Knights forum boards, direct email to the Council, or in writing to a member of the Council. Properly presented proposed amendments will be reviewed by the current Golden Gate Knights Council. During this review, the leadership will determine whether the proposed amendment violates other portions of the charter.

10.2 Upon approval of a properly presented amendment, the proposed amendment will be presented via posting in the Members Only section under Elections. This posting will contain the entire proposal along with a yes or no poll for the members to cast their vote. The poll will be available for a stated time period to last no less than 1 (one) week.

10.2a Proposed amendments must receive a two-thirds majority approval of all votes cast to be implemented in the official Golden Gate Knights charter.

11.5 Events may be approved with certain aspects of the request denied, e.g. if the sponsor of the event requests a combat performance but the venue is deemed not safe enough, then the event may be approved only as a meet & greet event.

11.6 Prior scheduled events and membership availability will be a factor on the approval of all events.

11.7 Upon approval by the Council, a designated Event Coordinator will post the event on the forum boards with a request for volunteers.

11.8 The Event Coordinator (or their designated assistant) will become the official point of contact with the event sponsor to work through all details of the event.

11.9 At no time should any member guarantee or cancel the Golden Gate Knights' participation in any event without prior approval by the Council.

11.10 Upon accepting the criteria for an event, appropriate members will be asked to volunteer for positions relating to the performance. These positions include Event Coordinator and Fight Director.

12 Member Ranks
There will be four basic ranks amongst all members based upon skill level and merit. These are a separate progression from the roles of Support Membership, Performance Membership, and Council Membership. These ranks are as follows:

12.1 Initiate Requirements
The rank of initiate is reserved to anyone who is participating within the Golden Gate Knights group through our instructional classes. All Initiates must meet these requirements:

12.1a Must meet all General Membership requirements (Section 5.1).

13 Performance Roles
For any performance or event, there are several roles that need to be fulfilled. Performance roles can be filled by anyone who is considered a part of the Performance membership or by designation of the  LMO.

13.1 Fight Director
The Fight Director must be present and responsible for the performance choreography of any event.

13.1a A Fight Director may be chosen from the membership of the Golden Gate Knights or a third-party may be enlisted.

13.2 Costume Judge
The costume judge is responsible for inspecting costumes of performance membership applicants for quality, in order to maintain the appearance of characters true to the Star Wars universe. This position is appointed by the Local Membership Officer, and must answer to the LMO on any decisions.

13.2a The costume judge will oversee the inspection of all Hero costumes in accordance with the hero Costume standards (Section 9.1), both at the time the costume is submitted with an application for performance membership and, if need be, before an event. If a Hero costume is not approved, then the costume judge will supply to the applicant a detailed report on why the costume was not approved, and if possible, to offer suggestions to improve the costume.

13.2b The costume judge, in partnership with the Fight Director of any given event, will inspect the quality of Stunt costumes in accordance with the costume standards (Section 9.2). If the Stunt costume does not meet the quality standards for Stunt costumes, the costume judge will supply the member with a report on why the costume was not approved for appearance standards. The costume judge does not judge the safety aspects of Stunt costumes, as that is at the discretion of the Fight Director for the event.
